# Fast_UNet
Fast UNET segmentation of Winter Wheat
In this research, a newly modified UNet (Fast-UNet) was implemented to segment winter wheat from time series Sentinel-2 images for the years 2021 and 2023. 
These images were converted to NDVI and utilized to identify wheat fields by tracking the wheat phenology from sowing to harvesting.
